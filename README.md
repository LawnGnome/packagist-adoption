# Packagist Adoption

This is a really basic, terribly written single page app that uses the
Packagist API to chart adoption of packages on Packagist by major, minor, and
all versions. (The latter is usually useless.)

## Development

It's easiest to stand this up via Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Go to http://localhost:8070/ and enjoy!
